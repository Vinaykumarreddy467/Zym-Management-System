# Zym Management System

## Project Overview

The **Zym Management System** is a robust and scalable application designed to streamline the operations of modern fitness centers and gyms. This full-stack solution facilitates efficient management of members, memberships, classes, staff, and financial transactions, aiming to enhance administrative productivity and improve the overall member experience. Developed with a clear separation of concerns, the system leverages a powerful Java backend and a dynamic Angular frontend to provide a responsive and reliable platform.

---

## Architecture

The system follows a classic client-server architecture, divided into distinct frontend and backend components:

* **Frontend:** Built with **Angular**, this serves as the user interface, providing interactive dashboards and forms for various administrative and operational tasks. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
* **Backend:** Developed using **Java**, this robust layer handles business logic, data processing, security, and integration with the database. It exposes a set of RESTful APIs consumed by the frontend.

---

## Technologies Used

The Zym Management System is built upon a modern and widely adopted technology stack, ensuring maintainability, performance, and scalability:

* **Backend:**
    * **Java:** The core programming language for server-side development.
    * *(Further Java frameworks/libraries like Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc., would typically be listed here if known.)*
* **Frontend:**
    * **Angular:** A powerful TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic single-page applications.
    * **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
    * **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
    * **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.

---

## Key Features

The system is designed to offer a comprehensive suite of features essential for gym management:

* **Member Management:**
    * Member registration and profile management.
    * Attendance tracking.
    * Membership status and history.
* **Membership Management:**
    * Creation and configuration of various membership plans (e.g., monthly, annual, class-based).
    * Membership activation, renewal, and cancellation.
    * Automated billing and payment tracking.
* **Class & Schedule Management:**
    * Creation and scheduling of fitness classes.
    * Trainer assignment and availability management.
    * Class booking and capacity management.
* **Staff Management:**
    * Management of gym employees and their roles.
    * Tracking of staff attendance and payroll.
* **Reporting & Analytics:**
    * Dashboards for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as member count, revenue, and class attendance.
    * Generation of reports on memberships, payments, and operational activities.
* **Authentication & Authorization:**
    * Secure user authentication for different roles (e.g., Admin, Staff).
    * Role-based access control to various functionalities.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Zym Management System locally for development or testing purposes, follow these detailed steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
* **Node.js:** Latest LTS version (includes npm).
* **Angular CLI:** Install globally via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Database System:** A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2 for development).
* **Maven/Gradle:** (If applicable for Java backend project management, usually included with IDEs).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vinaykumarreddy467/Zym-Management-System.git](https://github.com/Vinaykumarreddy467/Zym-Management-System.git)
    cd Zym-Management-System
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Java):**
    * Navigate into the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * **Database Configuration:** Locate the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file (typically in `src/main/resources`). Update the database connection properties (URL, username, password) to match your local database setup.
        ```properties
        # Example for application.properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/zym_db
        spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
        spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Or create for first run
        ```
    * **Build and Run:** Use your preferred build tool (Maven or Gradle) to build and run the application.
        ```bash
        # If using Maven:
        mvn clean install
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
        The backend server should start, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or as configured).

3.  **Frontend Setup (Angular):**
    * Navigate back to the root of the project and then into the `Frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../Frontend
        ```
    * **Install Dependencies:** Install all required Node.js packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * **Start the Development Server:** Launch the Angular development server:
        ```bash
        ng serve --open
        ```
        This command will compile the Angular application and open it in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:4200`.

## API Endpoints (Conceptual)

The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs to manage various entities. Typical endpoints might include:

* `/api/members`
* `/api/memberships`
* `/api/classes`
* `/api/staff`
* `/api/payments`
* `/api/auth` (for authentication)

*(Detailed API documentation, e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI, would be linked or described here.)*

---

## Database Schema (Conceptual)

The database schema would typically include tables for:

* `Members` (id, name, contact, membership_id, etc.)
* `Memberships` (id, type, duration, price, etc.)
* `Classes` (id, name, description, schedule, trainer_id, capacity, etc.)
* `Staff` (id, name, role, contact, etc.)
* `Payments` (id, member_id, amount, date, status, etc.)
* `Users` (for authentication, linked to staff/members)

*(An ERD or detailed schema description would be beneficial here.)*

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Zym Management System include:

* Integration with payment gateways for online transactions.
* Mobile application support.
* Advanced reporting and analytics features.
* Trainer-specific portals for managing their classes and members.
* Push notifications for class reminders or membership renewals.
* Integration with access control systems (e.g., turnstiles).
